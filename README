NAME

    XSLoader - Dynamically load C libraries into Perl code


DESCRIPTION

    This module defines a standard *simplified* interface to the dynamic
    linking mechanisms available on many platforms. Its primary purpose is
    to implement cheap automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules.

    For a more complicated interface, see DynaLoader. Many (most) features
    of DynaLoader are not implemented in XSLoader, like for example the
    dl_load_flags, not honored by XSLoader.


INSTALLATION

    Install this module using the usual mantra: 

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

    To install the extension in a private directory, you can use the PREFIX 
    option when creating Makefile.PL.

    This release of XSLoader has been tested by the author on the following 
    systems: 

      - Perl 5.4.76 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.5.670 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.6.2 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.8.5 i386-linux-thread-multi (vendor build)
      - Perl blead@25582 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.6.0 darwin (vendor build)
      - Perl 5.6.2 darwin (custom build)
      - Perl 5.8.6 cygwin (vendor build)

    and confirmed to work by Steve Peters on OpenBSD, Cygwin and ActivePerl.
