NAME

    XSLoader - Dynamically load C libraries into Perl code


DESCRIPTION

    This module defines a standard *simplified* interface to the dynamic
    linking mechanisms available on many platforms. Its primary purpose is
    to implement cheap automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules.  For a 
    more complicated interface, see DynaLoader. 


INSTALLATION

    Install this module using the usual mantra: 

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

    To install the extension in a private directory, you can use the PREFIX 
    option when executing Makefile.PL.

    This release of XSLoader has been tested by the author on the following 
    Perl and system versions but is likely to run on many more: 

      - Perl 5.4.5 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.5.3 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.6.2 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.8.5 i386-linux-thread-multi (vendor build)
      - Perl 5.8.8 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.4.5 x86_64-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.6.2 x86_64-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.8.7 x86_64-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.9.4-blead@28397 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.6.0 darwin (vendor build)
      - Perl 5.8.6 darwin-thread-multi-2level (vendor build)
      - Perl 5.8.8 i386-freebsd-64int (custom build/dor)
      - Perl 5.9.5-blead@28998 built for i386-freebsd-64int (custom build)
