NAME

    XSLoader - Dynamically load C libraries into Perl code


DESCRIPTION

    This module defines a standard *simplified* interface to the dynamic
    linking mechanisms available on many platforms. Its primary purpose is
    to implement cheap automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules.  For a 
    more complicated interface, see DynaLoader. 


INSTALLATION

    Install this module using the usual mantra: 

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

    To install the extension in a private directory, you can use the PREFIX 
    option when executing Makefile.PL.

    This release of XSLoader has been tested by the author on the following 
    systems: 

      - Perl 5.4.5 i686-linux (custom build)
      - Perl 5.5.3 i686-linux (custom build)
