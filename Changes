History for XSLoader

0.14 - 2011.04.16 - SAPER #PerlQA2011
    - [CODE] Updated from bleadperl:
       - XSLoader::load() with no arguments can use caller to find
         a default package (Nicholas Clark).
       - Avoid defining a full XSLoader::bootstrap_inherit post 5.6,
         as it's not needed (Nicholas Clark).
       - Small optimisation: for the generated XSLoader.pm, avoid a
         runtime lexical which is constant (Nicholas Clark).
    - [TESTS] Updated from bleadperl, solving RT-CPAN #54132, #61332.
    - [TESTS] Fixed tests for old Perls.
    - [TESTS] Added t/00-load.t and t/01-api.t, to provide basic tests
      when the main ones are skipped.

    - [CODE] Commented a debug statement which seems to confuse some Perl
      builts with -DDEBUGGING (Rafael Garcia-Suarez).

      dynamic loading (Andy Dougherty).
